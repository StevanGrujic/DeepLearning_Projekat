## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field encompassing various subdomains such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning (DL), and Machine Learning (ML). One of the challenges in AI is developing models that can quickly adapt to new tasks or domains, a problem that transfer learning addresses by enabling the transfer of knowledge from one domain to another.

## Transfer Learning

### Basic Concepts

Transfer learning involves applying knowledge gained from one task to a different, but related task. It is a crucial aspect of AI, allowing models to perform better in new domains even with limited data.

### Transfer Learning Taxonomy

Transfer learning can be categorized into:

1. **Homogeneous Transfer Learning**: Domains share similar feature spaces.
2. **Heterogeneous Transfer Learning**: Domains have different feature spaces.

According to the supervision available in the target domain, transfer learning can also be classified into:

- **Supervised Transfer Learning**
- **Semi-supervised Transfer Learning**
- **Unsupervised Transfer Learning**

### Deep Neural Networks and Transfer Learning

Deep neural networks are particularly well-suited for transfer learning. In these models, lower layers typically learn general features that can be transferred to different tasks, while higher layers specialize in task-specific features. This project leverages pre-training and fine-tuning, which are common techniques in transfer learning for deep networks.

### Pre-training and Fine-tuning

Pre-training involves training a model on a large dataset, which serves as a foundation for the task-specific model. Fine-tuning is the process of adjusting the pre-trained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset to improve performance.

## Evolution of GPT Models

The GPT series has evolved significantly:

1. **GPT-1**: Introduced the transformer architecture, trained on 40GB of data.
2. **GPT-2**: Expanded on GPT-1, with 1.5 billion parameters, significantly improving performance in various NLP tasks.
3. **GPT-3**: Increased the model size to 175 billion parameters, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning.
4. **GPT-4**: Introduced multimodal capabilities, allowing the model to process both text and images.

## Practical Implementation

### Data and Model Preparation

The dataset consists of tweets categorized into positive and negative sentiments. Preprocessing involves tokenization, balancing the dataset, and splitting it into training, testing, and validation sets. The GPT-2 model, retrieved from HuggingFace, is fine-tuned on this dataset.

Key steps include:

1. **Tokenization**: Convert text into a format suitable for GPT-2.
2. **Padding**: Ensure all sequences are of uniform length.
3. **Attention Masks**: Guide the model on which tokens to focus on.

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning involves adding custom layers to the pre-trained GPT-2 model to adapt it to the sentiment analysis task. This process includes freezing the initial layers of GPT-2 and training only the newly added layers to classify sentiments accurately.

### Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the TensorFlow library, with custom parameters set for the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Evaluation is conducted by measuring the modelâ€™s performance on the test set using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning and GPT models in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis. By fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model, it is possible to achieve high accuracy even with a limited dataset, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness of transfer learning.
